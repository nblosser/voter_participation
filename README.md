# Voter Participation
Voter participation analysis - independent project
 
  ### Name: Nicole Blosser
 
 ## Project Overview.
 
I pulled several datasets from the Election Administration and Voting Survery (EAVS) from years: 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022. I cleaned them in SQL and connected those databases to Tableau. In Tableau, all the years from the data sets were combined via union, and the final steps of cleaning were performed. An additional dataset was created based on information scraped from various sources regarding the implementation of voter id laws. The data will be visually explored in Tableau to identify relationships between variables and their impact on voter participation, with a specific interest on the possible impact of voter identification laws on voter participation.

 
 ## Business Problem.
 
Voter participation is a notoriously difficult factor to project. Several determinents can influence this number, and I would like to explore this topic more. I would specifically like to look at the role voter identification requirements plays in voter particiaption rates, if any.
